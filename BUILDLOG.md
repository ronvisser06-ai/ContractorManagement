## Session Entries

### Session 2026-06-23 — Design Phase Complete

**What I Built** (design, not code):
- Locked the "What": FunctionalOverview.md (six roles, one-orientation-per-site, worker-centric single QR, crew activation, SMS/kiosk, lockout, requalification).
- Locked the "How": ExecutionPlan.md (milestones M0–M5, locked stack, AI-agent roadmap), HowDesign-DataModel.md (three-domain schema + RLS + identity), HowDesign-QRVerification.md (worker-centric verification), orientation_pipeline_contracts_v0.1.md (pipeline contracts + §7 bounded editor).
- Ran a design-rationalization deep dive (DesignRationalization.md) and folded all decisions back in.
- Installed the Jacques coaching system in this project (CLAUDE.md tailored, JACQUES.md, JACQUES_QUICK_START.md, SETUP.md, this BUILDLOG).

**What Went Wrong**:
- Nothing — design phase. Two prior decisions were deliberately revised in the deep dive (per-site QR → per-worker; company-only site association → + crew activation).

**What's Next**:
- **M0 — Foundations & Walking Skeleton.** First single feature to scope with Jacques (likely: project scaffold + Supabase auth + one role-protected page), then build outward to core schema + RLS and the stubbed job pipeline.
- Decide where code lives (Claude Code on the repo vs. here) and stand up the git repo.

**Rules Followed**:
- ✓ Thought before prompting; planned thoroughly before any code (Rules 1, 2)
- ✓ Tech stack decided upfront (Rule 5)
- ✓ Constraints written down (Rule 12)

**Context Usage**: Fresh — ready to start M0 in a focused conversation.

### Session 2026-06-24 — M0 / Feature 1, Step 1 — Scaffold + Deploy

**What I Built**:
- Scaffolded Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript strict + Tailwind + shadcn/ui into `web/`.
- Local dev build clean; TypeScript strict compile clean.
- Committed both the scaffold and root doc updates, pushed to GitHub (`ronvisser06-ai/ContractorManagement`, private).
- Deployed live on Vercel — production build green.

**What Went Wrong**:
- **Vercel 404 (Root Directory)**: Vercel defaulted to the repo root; fixed by setting Root Directory to `web` in project settings.
- **Case mismatch**: Vercel resolved the folder as `Web` (capital W) — fixed by correcting the Root Directory to exact lowercase `web`.
- **Framework Preset defaulting to "Other"**: With the wrong root Vercel couldn't detect Next.js; fixed automatically once Root Directory was correct and preset set to Next.js.

**What's Next**:
- **Step 2 — Supabase + Drizzle + four-table migration with RLS**: stand up the DB connection, write the core schema (orgs, sites, users, orientations), add RLS policies, run the migration against Supabase.
- Sentry integration deferred to a quick micro-step (not blocking Step 2).

**Rules Followed**:
- ✓ Planned before coding (Rules 1, 2)
- ✓ One feature at a time (Rule 6)
- ✓ Tested in browser — local + production (Rule 7)
- ✓ Committed and pushed to git (Rule 9)

**Context Usage**: Fresh — starting Step 2 in a new focused conversation.

### Session 2026-06-24 — M0 / Feature 1, Step 2 — Supabase + Drizzle + Schema + RLS

**What I Built**:
- Installed `drizzle-orm`, `drizzle-kit`, `postgres`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `@supabase/ssr`, `ulid`, `dotenv`.
- Drizzle schema for the four foundation tables: `users` (uuid PK = auth.uid), `organizations`, `sites`, `org_memberships` — with four enums (`user_status`, `org_status`, `org_role`, `membership_status`) and `citext` on `primary_email`.
- Migration `0000_premium_pretty_boy.sql`: citext extension, DDL for all four tables, RLS enabled on all four, `user_org_ids(uid)` SECURITY DEFINER helper, seven RLS policies.
- `drizzle.config.ts`, `db:generate` / `db:migrate` / `db:studio` npm scripts, `newId(prefix)` ULID utility.
- `/api/health` smoke test: confirmed all four tables present and RLS enabled.
- Migration applied to Supabase via the session-mode pooler.

**What Went Wrong**:
- **Direct DB host unreachable**: `db.[ref].supabase.co` resolves only to an IPv6 address; the Claude Code sandbox has no IPv6 routing to the internet. Fixed by switching `DATABASE_URL` to the Supabase shared pooler (`aws-1-ca-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432`).
- **Duplicate key in `.env.local`**: copy-paste error wrote `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=…`; corrected manually.
- **Special chars in DB password**: `!`, `&`, `^` in the password must be URL-encoded (`%21`, `%26`, `%5E`) in the connection string; fixed in `.env.local`.

**What's Next**:
- **Step 3 — Auth**: register / login / logout / session; `handle_new_user` trigger; protected `/app` page; RLS isolation test.

**Rules Followed**:
- ✓ Read design docs before writing schema (Rules 1, 2)
- ✓ One feature at a time (Rule 6)
- ✓ Smoke-tested via `/api/health` (Rule 7)
- ✓ Committed and pushed (Rule 9)

**Context Usage**: Same conversation as Step 1 — compact before Step 3.

### Session 2026-06-24 — M0 / Feature 1, Step 3 — Auth + Users Trigger + Protected /app

**What I Built**:
- Supabase SSR wiring: `createBrowserClient` (`src/lib/supabase/client.ts`), async `createServerClient` (`src/lib/supabase/server.ts`), middleware that refreshes the session cookie on every request and guards `/app` → `/login` (unauthenticated) and `/login|/register` → `/app` (already authenticated).
- Postgres `SECURITY DEFINER` trigger `handle_new_user` on `auth.users` — auto-creates `public.users` profile row on signup, reading `given_name` and `family_name` from `raw_user_meta_data`. Applied as migration `0001_auth_trigger.sql`.
- Register page (`/register`): given name, family name, email, password; handles email-confirmation-required state ("check your email").
- Login page (`/login`) and `logout` server action.
- Protected `/app` page: reads profile via Supabase client (anon key + user JWT, so RLS is enforced); shows name/email + live RLS check — `SELECT * FROM users` returns exactly 1 row (own row only).
- shadcn `Input` and `Label` UI primitives added.
- TypeScript strict: zero errors across all new files.

**What Went Wrong**:
- Nothing broke. One cold-start false alarm: first curl to `/login` returned 500 due to dev-server startup lag; resolved after warmup.

**What's Next**:
- **Step 4 — RLS tightening + two-tenant isolation test**: write the automated cross-tenant test (second user cannot read first user's org/sites); harden any policy gaps found.
- **Step 5 — Create org → client_admin membership**: org creation form, service-role insert of org + membership in one transaction.

**Rules Followed**:
- ✓ Read design docs + Next.js 16 dist/docs before writing framework code (Rules 1, 2)
- ✓ One feature at a time (Rule 6)
- ✓ Tested register → refresh → logout in browser (Rule 7)
- ✓ TypeScript strict clean before commit (Rule 7)
- ✓ Committed and pushed (Rule 9)

**Context Usage**: Same conversation — compact or fresh conversation before Step 4.

### Session 2026-06-24 — M0 / Feature 1, Step 4 — Org Creation + Client Admin Membership

**What I Built**:
- Migration `0002_create_org_rpc.sql`: `create_organization(p_org_id, p_org_name, p_membership_id)` — SECURITY DEFINER Postgres function that inserts `organizations` + `org_memberships(roles=[client_admin], status=active)` atomically in one transaction. Guards: `auth.uid() IS NULL` and empty name both raise exceptions. IDs are prefixed ULIDs generated in TypeScript and passed in so ULID format stays consistent project-wide.
- `/onboarding/create-org` page + server action: org name form → `supabase.rpc('create_organization', …)` → redirect to `/app`. Skips onboarding if user already has an active membership.
- `/app` updated: queries `org_memberships` (RLS-filtered, so user only sees their own); redirects to `/onboarding/create-org` if no active membership; shows org name + role badge (e.g. "Client Admin").
- Middleware extended to guard `/onboarding/*` paths alongside `/app`.
- TypeScript strict: zero errors.

**What Went Wrong**:
- Nothing broke.

**What's Next**:
- **Step 5 — Sites: create + list, scoped to the org**: site name form on `/app/sites`, server action inserts via Supabase client (RLS enforces org scope), list refreshes after creation.

**Rules Followed**:
- ✓ Read design docs §3.2 + §4.1 before building (Rules 1, 2)
- ✓ One feature at a time (Rule 6)
- ✓ Tested register → create org → refresh → logout/login in browser (Rule 7)
- ✓ TypeScript strict clean before commit (Rule 7)
- ✓ Committed and pushed (Rule 9)

**Context Usage**: Same conversation — fresh conversation before Step 5.

### Session 2026-06-24 — M0 / Feature 1, Step 5 — Sites: Create + List, Org-Scoped

**What I Built**:
- `/app/sites` page: lists the caller's org's sites (queried via the Supabase client so RLS applies); create form (name only) shown only when the caller holds `client_admin` in that org.
- `createSite` server action (`src/app/app/sites/actions.ts`): resolves `org_id` from the caller's own active `org_memberships` row (never trusts client input), inserts via the Supabase client — the existing `"sites: write if client_admin"` RLS policy (shipped in migration `0000`) is what actually blocks non-admins, the UI gating is just the friendly layer on top.
- Added a "Manage sites" link from `/app` to `/app/sites`.
- No new migration needed — the sites table + RLS policies already existed from Step 2.

**What Went Wrong**:
- Nothing in the app code. Tooling-only snag: no browser automation was available in-session (no `chromium-cli`, no Playwright pre-installed). Installed `playwright` standalone in the scratch dir (`PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1`) and drove the existing system Edge install via `channel: 'msedge'` instead of downloading a bundled Chromium.
- Email confirmation is enabled on the Supabase project, so registering through the UI doesn't yield a session. Created two confirmed test users directly via the Supabase Admin API (service-role key, `auth.admin.createUser` with `email_confirm: true`) to get two real tenants to test cross-org isolation against.

**Verified in browser** (two real tenants, via Playwright/Edge):
- Tenant A creates "Plant A1" → appears immediately → persists after reload.
- Tenant B's `/app/sites` shows zero sites (cannot see "Plant A1"); creates "Plant B1" → appears.
- Back on Tenant A: still sees only "Plant A1" — confirms org-scoping holds in both directions.

**What's Next**:
- **Step 6 — Role-aware empty dashboard shell**, then deploy to staging — closes out Feature 1 / M0's foundation slice per `Feature1-Foundation-Brief.md`.

**Rules Followed**:
- ✓ Read `HowDesign-DataModel.md` §3.2/§4.1 + `Feature1-Foundation-Brief.md` before building (Rules 1, 2)
- ✓ One feature at a time (Rule 6)
- ✓ TypeScript strict, lint, and production build all clean
- ✓ Tested create → persist → cross-tenant isolation in a real browser (Rule 7)
- ✓ Committed and pushed (Rule 9)

**Context Usage**: Same conversation — fresh conversation before Step 6.

### Session 2026-06-24 — M0 / Feature 1, Step 6 — Role-Aware Shell + Automated Isolation Test (Feature 1 complete)

**What I Built**:
- `src/app/app/layout.tsx`: shared shell for all `/app/*` routes. Reads the caller's role(s) from `org_memberships` once, shows the org name + role badge, and renders nav driven by a small `NAV_ITEMS`/`COMING_SOON` table keyed on `org_role` (imported from `db/schema.ts` so the role list has one source of truth). `client_admin` sees a live "Sites" link; `client_admin`/`content_developer`/`content_approver` see "Contractors"/"Orientations" as inert "Soon"-badged placeholders — nothing routes there, by design (no new feature pages). Logout moved here from the dashboard.
- Trimmed `/app/page.tsx` and `/app/sites/page.tsx` down to just their page content now that the header/nav/org/role chrome lives in the layout — removes the duplicate header markup both pages used to carry.
- `npm test`: added a `test` script running Node's **built-in** test runner (`node --env-file=.env.local --test`) against `.test.mts` files — no new test-framework dependency. Node 24's native TS type-stripping runs the `.ts` syntax directly; `.mts` avoids the CJS/ESM ambiguity warning.
- `src/test/two-tenant-isolation.test.mts`: the regression net from CLAUDE.md §7. Seeds two throwaway users via the Supabase admin API, signs each in, has each create an org + site through the real app path (`create_organization` RPC + a `sites` insert), then asserts under RLS: neither tenant can read the other's org or site (by direct id lookup *or* via an unfiltered listing), and tenant B's *write* into tenant A's org is rejected. Cleans up (auth user + all seeded rows) in an `after()` hook — verified no leftover rows/users after a run.
- `tsconfig.json` already globbed `**/*.mts`, so the test file is strict-TS-checked along with the rest of the app; no config changes needed there.

**What Went Wrong**:
- First dev-server restart after a fresh `npm run build` threw repeated `EPERM: operation not permitted, rename ...` errors inside `.next/dev/` (the repo lives inside a Dropbox-synced folder, which intermittently locks files mid-write on Windows). Fixed by killing the dev process, deleting `.next`, and restarting clean.
- No other surprises — RLS already enforced everything the isolation test checks; the test exists to keep it that way as the schema evolves.

**Verified**:
- `tsc --noEmit`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` all clean.
- `npm test` → all 7 isolation assertions pass against the live Supabase project; confirmed zero leftover seeded users/orgs afterward.
- Browser (Playwright/Edge), desktop + 375px mobile viewport: role-aware nav renders correctly for a Client Admin (Sites live, Contractors/Orientations "Soon"), no horizontal overflow at mobile width, and the full Feature 1 acceptance path holds end-to-end — create site → persists on reload → second tenant sees none of it.
- **Feature 1 (M0 foundation slice) Definition of Done is met**: register → login → create org → add site → refresh persists → second tenant isolated, proven both manually and by an automated test; lint + build green; BUILDLOG updated.

**What's Next**:
- `Jacques, ship check` → deploy (push auto-deploys to Vercel) → `Jacques, what's next` for **Feature 2**: the stubbed job-state-machine skeleton + fixed renderer (M0's remaining piece per `ExecutionPlan.md`, ahead of the real generation pipeline in M2).

**Rules Followed**:
- ✓ Read `Feature1-Foundation-Brief.md` + `HowDesign-DataModel.md` §2/§4 before building (Rules 1, 2)
- ✓ One feature at a time (Rule 6)
- ✓ Built the RLS regression-net test per §7, not just a manual check
- ✓ TypeScript strict, lint, and build all clean; tested in a real browser, including mobile width (Rule 7)
- ✓ No new runtime/test-framework dependency — used Node's built-in test runner (Rule 12, stack discipline)
- ✓ Committed and pushed (Rule 9)

**Context Usage**: Same conversation — fresh conversation before Feature 2.
