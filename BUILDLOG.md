# Build Log — Contractor Orientation Management

After each development session, record:
1. **What I built today**
2. **What went wrong and how I fixed it**
3. **What I want to build next**

This tracks progress and lets you pick up exactly where you left off (Rule 19).

## Session Entries

### Session 2026-06-23 — Design Phase Complete

**What I Built** (design, not code):
- Locked the "What": FunctionalOverview.md (six roles, one-orientation-per-site, worker-centric single QR, crew activation, SMS/kiosk, lockout, requalification).
- Locked the "How": ExecutionPlan.md (milestones M0–M5, locked stack, AI-agent roadmap), HowDesign-DataModel.md (three-domain schema + RLS + identity), HowDesign-QRVerification.md (worker-centric verification), orientation_pipeline_contracts_v0.1.md (pipeline contracts + §7 bounded editor).
- Ran a design-rationalization deep dive (DesignRationalization.md) and folded all decisions back in.
- Installed the Jacques coaching system in this project (CLAUDE.md tailored, JACQUES.md, JACQUES_QUICK_START.md, SETUP.md, this BUILDLOG).

**What Went Wrong**:
- Nothing — design phase. Two prior decisions were deliberately revised in the deep dive (per-site QR → per-worker; company-only site association → + crew activation).

**What's Next**:
- **M0 — Foundations & Walking Skeleton.** First single feature to scope with Jacques (likely: project scaffold + Supabase auth + one role-protected page), then build outward to core schema + RLS and the stubbed job pipeline.
- Decide where code lives (Claude Code on the repo vs. here) and stand up the git repo.

**Rules Followed**:
- ✓ Thought before prompting; planned thoroughly before any code (Rules 1, 2)
- ✓ Tech stack decided upfront (Rule 5)
- ✓ Constraints written down (Rule 12)

**Context Usage**: Fresh — ready to start M0 in a focused conversation.

### Session 2026-06-24 — M0 / Feature 1, Step 1 — Scaffold + Deploy

**What I Built**:
- Scaffolded Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript strict + Tailwind + shadcn/ui into `web/`.
- Local dev build clean; TypeScript strict compile clean.
- Committed both the scaffold and root doc updates, pushed to GitHub (`ronvisser06-ai/ContractorManagement`, private).
- Deployed live on Vercel — production build green.

**What Went Wrong**:
- **Vercel 404 (Root Directory)**: Vercel defaulted to the repo root; fixed by setting Root Directory to `web` in project settings.
- **Case mismatch**: Vercel resolved the folder as `Web` (capital W) — fixed by correcting the Root Directory to exact lowercase `web`.
- **Framework Preset defaulting to "Other"**: With the wrong root Vercel couldn't detect Next.js; fixed automatically once Root Directory was correct and preset set to Next.js.

**What's Next**:
- **Step 2 — Supabase + Drizzle + four-table migration with RLS**: stand up the DB connection, write the core schema (orgs, sites, users, orientations), add RLS policies, run the migration against Supabase.
- Sentry integration deferred to a quick micro-step (not blocking Step 2).

**Rules Followed**:
- ✓ Planned before coding (Rules 1, 2)
- ✓ One feature at a time (Rule 6)
- ✓ Tested in browser — local + production (Rule 7)
- ✓ Committed and pushed to git (Rule 9)

**Context Usage**: Fresh — starting Step 2 in a new focused conversation.
